	<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a  group of students who are attending SMASH(Summer Math And Science Honors).SMASH is a three-year STEM- intensive residential college prep program that empowers students to deepen their talents and pursue STEM careers. Every summer, scholars are immersed in tuition-free studies at leading universities throughout the country.  During the academic year, scholars participate in monthly programming. Including a final project that is focused on disease. To supplement, our disease is Hansen/Leprosy that no many people are informed about.</p>
