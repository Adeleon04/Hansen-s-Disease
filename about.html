	<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are four high school student who come from low -income communities who are attending SMASH(Summer Math And Science Honors).SMASH is a three-year STEM- intensive residential college prep program that empowers students to deepen their talents and pursue STEM careers. Every summer, scholars are immersed in tuition-free studies at leading universities throughout the country.  During the academic year, scholars participate in monthly programming. Including a final project that is focused on disease. To supplement, our disease is Hansen/Leprosy that no many people are informed about.</p>

<h1>Mission and Vision</h1>
<p>Our mission is to create a service that partners with clinics in Leprosy Prone communities to raise awareness of Leprosy, Offer free & efficient testing. Plus Providing free leprosy treatment.</p>
<br>

	<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>We have noticed, through research and interviews, that many people don't have sufficient knowledge about leprosy and its symptoms. In low-income countries, typically those near the Equator, there is also less access to adequate healthcare. This creates a cycle where those who may be infected with Hansen's Disease don't have methods of detection, and can't receive the necessary treatments.</p>
